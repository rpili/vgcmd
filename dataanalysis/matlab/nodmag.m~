% script to take in a starting time and duration across which to measure
% changes in pitch, yaw, and roll in the csv output of OpenFace. For ONE
% nod or headshake.
% i.e. measures the distance travelled or angle travelled in each axis.
%
% [dpitch, dyaw, droll] = nodmag(onset, duration)
% input:
%       onset    = the second where a single head movement begins (or slightly
%       before)
%       duration = how many seconds the head movement lasts
% output:
%       dpitch = distance / angle travelled in pitch 
%       dyaw   = distance / angle travelled in yaw
%       droll  = distance / angle travelled in roll
