[TutorialStory]
experimenter: sweet okay and then yeah you’ll just be basically playing with the other player

9: okay
experimenter: i’ll be out there
9: okay

[TutorialGameplay]
        8: i have no idea how this game works
        8: ok wait
        9: um press space to pick up
8: *there we go 
9: *ya
8: *okay
9: umm
8: now i guess i give it back to you
9: *i think so
9: uhh
8: wait i can dash oh wow
9: um
9: shoot
8: wait do we put it the same place or do we have to like
8: oh im very confused
9:um i dont know if im doing this right
8: *i think so
8: um it hasn’t- we’ve haven’t like  had to stop doin anything so i guess we’re doing it right
9: *okay
8: oh i see how this works now
9: is it just the same thing over and over
8: i think so i think that’s why it’s like a tutorial cause like i thought  we had to mix them and we had to like actually make a recipe but no i think we’re just chopping shit and throwing it in the oven
9: *okay
8: *ooo ah
8: this is just going forever
9: i don’t know seems like it
8: it’s not ending
9: are we doing something wrong
8: I-I i think so cause like there’s a timer on the bottom right hand corner and it’s been on 1:30 for like at least a minute and thirty seconds so
8: ohh i think i see what we’re supposed to do 
9: *what 
8: i think we’re supposed to somehow combine these to-uh
8: what did I-
9: oh you can throw
8: i can throw it
8: i did not know that was a thing what
9: how’d  you do that
8: i think i double clicked space
9: no
8: no-what was it
8: *uagh wait
8: control space? *Oh there we go yea it’s control and space
9: *control and space okay
8: *yeah-
8: ok so somehow i think we combine the two cause i see a salad in the top left hand corner so im guessing that’s what we’re supposed to make
9: a salad *oh oh yeah okay so here 
9: *ohh yeah
8: that took us way too long
9: *wait whats
8: oh now we need cucumber *where do we oh there it is 
9: *right here
8: okay now we’re getting the hang of it there we go
9: *yeah okay
9: oh now we have two
8: do we have to serve it  at the same time or is it do we just make two things
9: i think we just make two things
8: *oh no there’s alot of orders coming in now
9: *oh now i know why we use dash
8: *oh yeah this makes sense now okay
9: *two oh i don’t have another plate
9: how do you throw away something *no wait actually
8: *oh no we can just create the other dish
9: *yeah
8: *there we go
8: *oh no no ah
8: *woah i didn’t know you could that 
8: *ohh sorry
9: *its okay
