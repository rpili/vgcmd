starting running notes for VGCMD
just downloaded drivers for 408Ewin's AMD driver from https://www.amd.com/en/support
	the auto detect program
now downloading steam and discord
downloaded steam -- question: should I create a lab steam account? or just use my own. 
downloaded discord -- I should probably create two lab discord accounts.
next is to download whatever streaming software they use -- i think it is obs studio.

setting up the layout of the monitor
need to use AutoSizer to force Zoom's video window to stay on top
have the game underneath -- can't find anyway to resize the screen
issue with game underneath -- person is looking down, hard to see their face from the camera
instead, place game above the video-feed
use AutoSizer to set position of the two windows manually each time!
for Overcooked 2: AutoSize > Resize/Position > Set Size: 1050 x 700 sets it nicely at the top -- just kidding the game auto resizes when a level is finished, and ends up underneath the layer of the Zoom video
if you put the game below the video, this issue doesn't occur
consider placing the camera beneath the monitor
unsure what to do about the layout in terms stacking the camera, the game, and the videochat

make the background of the computer all grey as well
