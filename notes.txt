starting running notes for VGCMD
just downloaded drivers for 408Ewin's AMD driver from https://www.amd.com/en/support
	the auto detect program
now downloading steam and discord
downloaded steam -- question: should I create a lab steam account? or just use my own. 
downloaded discord -- I should probably create two lab discord accounts.
next is to download whatever streaming software they use -- i think it is obs studio.
